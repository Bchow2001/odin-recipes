            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                I learned this dish from my good friend Marta when she came over to visit me in Egham.
                She described the town I lived in for my Uni as "very boring" but I guarantee you that this dish
                is in no way <em>boring</em>. 
            </p>
            <p>I have made some changes of my own to suit my tastes but this is a very versatile dish
                that you can experiment with!
            </p>
            <p>
                It is once again a very easy dish to make and more importantly can be made with only vegan ingredients for
                our more discerning friends.
