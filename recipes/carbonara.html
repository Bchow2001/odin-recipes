            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
               Carbonara is an Italian dish originating from <em><strong>Rome</strong></em>. It is made with eggs,
               hard cheese, cured pork, and <em>lots</em> of black pepper. Timing is everything with this dish,
               so practice is very welcome.

                I had this meal for the <em><strong>very first time</strong></em><s> definitely not a lie</s> in Rome with my very good friend

                it was better than the world famous <em><strong><a href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g187791-d13443832-Reviews-Tonnarello-Rome_Lazio.html">TONNARELLO</a></strong></em>

            <p>
                It is one of my favourite dishes to make, being both flavourful, classy and most importantly of all 
                <em>easy to make</em>.

                    <li>4 oz. Guanciale (soft cured pork jowl), 
                        Pancetta is an acceptable substitute, bacon is <em>not</em>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        2 oz.Pecorino Romano or Parmigiano Reggiano (similar mild hard cheeses are acceptable)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        4 Eggs, use an extra egg yolk for richness
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Freshly ground black pepper
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Olive oil
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Spaghettoni or Spaghetti
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </p>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Boil salted water</li>
                    <li>While water is boiling start frying the pancetta</li>
                    <li>Crack eggs into a bowl, beat, then add grated cheese and lots of pepper</li>
                    <li>Mix eggs, cheese and pepper together</li>
                    <li>Add pasta to boiling water</li>
                    <li>Fry pancetta until crispy then turn off heat</li>
                    <li>Once pasta is finished cooking, add pasta to the pan and mix well</li>
                        <ul>
                        <li>
                            You are making a fat sauce with the water from the pasta and the 
                            rendered fat from the pancetta
                        </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Gently pour egg mix into pan once the pan has cooled off enough</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The pan should basically be at the temperature of the pasta</li>
                            <li>It is important that you do not cook the eggs, 
                                otherwise you are simply making scrambled eggs</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Serve with a generous amount of grated cheese and pepper on top</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I am of the personal belief that it is impossible to use too much black 
                                pepper in this dish
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                </ol>
